		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		<p>BuildCommand is a brand new suite of tools which will place builders, contractors, suppliers, and homeowners in command of their projects. BuildCommand will provide builders all the tools they need to simply and effectively manage all aspects of the homebuilding life-cycle. Similar attention to detail will be paid to tools available for contractors (framers, drywallers, painters, etc),suppliers, and homeowners, allowing an amazing level of integration between accounts to make managing the day-to-day aspects of each project simple.  Due to the complex nature of creating an extremely simple to use (kind of an oxymoron isn't it?) and effective application, BuildCommand will be released in phases, some of the features are detailed below.</p>

		<h2>Project Estimation</h2>
		<p>You can't start building a house without an estimate and a budget (I guess you could, but you really shouldn't), so we figured that was a good place to begin building BuildCommand.  Builders will be able to create a quick project estimate from scratch or send out requests to contractors and suppliers.  These figures will be available for expense tracking as the project unfolds for comparison between estimated and actual incurred costs.</p>

		<h2>Classified Listings</h2>
		<p>While building homes (yes, it's true, we are home builders) one of the things we became aware of was that the amount of items in our storage seemed to increase with each home we built.  These items were usually new (or almost new), but couldn't be returned to the supplier, so they went in storage.  So, the first project we worked on was <a href="http://www.buildswap.com" alt="Buy and sell new and used materials, tools, and equipment">BuildSwap</a>.  BuildSwap is a hybrid between craigslist and eBay built specifically for the home building industry allowing users to buy and sell new and used building materials, tools, and equipment.</p>
